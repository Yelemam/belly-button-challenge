# Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard
Welcome to the Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard! ðŸ¦ 

This project explores the microbial diversity found in human navels. The dataset reveals that while most microbial species are rare, a few are found in 
over 70% of people. This dashboard allows you to interactively dive into the data and explore whatâ€™s living in our belly buttons!

# Project Overview

This dashboard provides visualizations and metadata for each sample in the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset.

# Features
# What Does This Dashboard Do?

 1. Top 10 OTUs Bar Chart: Visualizes the top 10 bacterial species (Operational Taxonomic Units or OTUs) found in each sample.
 2. Bubble Chart: Displays all the OTUs for the selected sample in a bubble chart.
 3. Demographic Info: Shows demographic information for each selected sample.
 4. Dynamic Dropdown: Allows users to select a sample ID, updating the bar chart, bubble chart, and demographic panel accordingly.

# How to Get Started
   1. Clone the Repo
   2. Open the Dashboard: Open the index.html file in your browser to view the dashboard locally.
   3. View the Live Version: The dashboard is live! Access it here: Live Dashboard.

# How It Works

The dashboard pulls its data from the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset using D3.js and visualizes the data using Plotly.js.

# Bar Chart

  . Displays the top 10 OTUs found in the selected sample.
  . The x-axis shows the sample values, and the y-axis shows the OTU IDs.
  . Hover over the bars to see additional info about each OTU.

# Bubble Chart

  . Shows all the OTUs in the selected sample.
  . The x-axis shows the OTU IDs, and the y-axis shows the sample values.
  . The size of each bubble represents how abundant that OTU is, and the colors differentiate between OTUs.
# Metadata Panel

  . Displays demographic information of the selected sample, including:
    . ID
    . Ethnicity
    . Gender
    . Age
    . Location

# Tech Stack
 This project uses:

  . D3.js: To load and manipulate the dataset.
  . Plotly.js: For interactive visualizations.
  . HTML/CSS/JavaScript: For building and styling the webpage.
  . GitHub Pages: For hosting the live version of the dashboard.
